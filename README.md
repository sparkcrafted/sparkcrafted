# Hey, I’m Warren 👋🏽   

I’m a management operations strategist currently adding DataOps engineering to my skill stack. I'm driven by mission, systems, and clarity through data. 

I work @ [Spark Professional Services](http://sparkproservices.com), where I help organizations work smarter, operate cleaner, and better decisions. I'm trained as an M.B.A. and have managed teams in industry, so I know people and business. 

I'm currently earning a M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization from the [Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management](http://morgan.edu/sbm), an AACSB-accredited graduate program at [Morgan State University](http://morgan.edu) in Baltimore, Maryland.
