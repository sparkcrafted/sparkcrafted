# Hey, I’m Warren 👋🏽   

I’m a management operations strategist currently adding DataOps engineering to my skill stack. I work @ [Spark Professional Services](http://sparkproservices.com), where I help organizations work smarter, operate cleaner, and better decisions. I'm driven by people, mission, systems, and clarity through data.

I'm trained as an M.B.A. and have managed teams in industry, so I know people and business. I'm getting to know data and quantitative analysis better by also earning a M.S. in Data Analytics and Visualization from the [Earl G. Graves School of Business and Management](http://morgan.edu/sbm) at [Morgan State University](http://morgan.edu).
